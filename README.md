# Resume-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

This repository showcases a machine learning project designed to automate the resume screening process. The objective is to build a model that evaluates resumes quickly and accurately based on predefined criteria.

Why Resume Screening?
Manual resume reviews are time-consuming and inefficient, especially for roles that attract hundreds or thousands of applicants.

Hiring teams must filter resumes by specific requirements, which can be tedious and error-prone.

Automating this process using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing can drastically reduce screening time from days to minutes.

Introduction
Resume screening is the process of evaluating candidate qualifications—education, experience, skills—based on resume content. It’s essentially a pattern-matching task: aligning job requirements with candidate profiles. The aim is to determine which applicants should move forward in the hiring pipeline.

Modules & Libraries
1.Key Modules
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): A supervised learning algorithm used for classification based on similarity with the closest training examples.

NLP (Natural Language Processing): Empowers the model to understand and interpret human language from resumes.

2.Libraries Used
NumPy: Efficient handling of arrays and matrices.

Pandas: Simplifies data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For high-quality data visualization.

SciPy: Scientific computing utilities.

Scikit-learn: Core machine learning library for training and evaluation.

NLTK: Toolkit for text preprocessing and language analysis.

Application Functionality
The screening system evaluates resumes based on the following criteria:

Work Experience

Educational Background

Relevant Skills

Soft Skills & Personality Traits

Job-specific Competencies

These attributes are analyzed to determine candidate suitability.

Tools & Technologies
This project leverages:

Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence

Natural Language Processing

Text Mining

These technologies form the foundation of automated resume screening systems (e.g., Applicant Tracking Systems).

AI Innovations in Screening AI for Recruitment is revolutionizing how resumes are screened.

These tools reduce manual workload and integrate seamlessly with existing recruitment workflows.

Automation enhances accuracy and speeds up the hiring process significantly.

Usage
Follow these steps to use the project:

Prepare your dataset of resumes. Preprocess the data using the provided scripts. Train the machine learning model. Use the trained model to screen new resumes. Detailed instructions for each step can be found in the Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository.

Dataset The dataset used for this project consists of resumes collected from various sources. The data is preprocessed to extract relevant features such as skills, experience, and education.

Model The project uses various machine learning models to evaluate resumes. These models are trained on labeled data to classify resumes based on predefined criteria. The models include:

Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines Random Forest Neural Networks Results The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are documented and visualized in the Jupyter notebooks.
