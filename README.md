# Deep Learning Project

This repository contains a deep learning project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The project involves building, training, and evaluating a neural network model using Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving a \[classification/regression] problem using a deep neural network. It covers:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Model design and compilation
* Model training and validation
* Evaluation on test data
* Visualization of results

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the code)
* scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages using:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-project.git
cd deep-learning-project


2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook


3. Open DEEP_LEARNING_PROJECT (1).ipynb and run the cells sequentially.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is \[name or description of dataset]. Make sure to place the dataset in the appropriate directory or update the path in the notebook if needed.
